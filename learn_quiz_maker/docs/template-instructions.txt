This file was meant for those to read more specifics on how to fill in the learn-quiz-template.xls sheet correct for each of the 8 different questions supported. 

I suggest taking creating a new Excel workbook and naming it learn-quiz-template.xlsl, then open the learn-quiz-template.xlsl found inside this folder and copy and paste the question types that you want inside of your new quiz Excel document. Fill in the question just like how it's done inside the same Excel template in this project. 

General Rules: 
  - Any fields that you don't need to fill in, simply leave it blank
  - Write all question configuration text (i.e. yes, no, true, false, all or nothing, right minus wrong) to be the most safe, please write them in lowercase
  - Each question is alotted it's own row
  - Lists of fields (i.e. option texts for multiple choice) must be written with parentheses around each text and connected with a dash "-", I call this format "text chain". For example, if you want to enter option text for 3 option fields you would write it as such: (text1)-(text2)-(text3), texts can also be blank as long as the text chain has enough parentheses that matches the Number of Options/Pairs/Text Fields field for that question.
  - A text chain cannot have less than 2 texts
